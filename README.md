# Temperature Monitoring System with LCD Display and DC Motor Control üå°Ô∏èüîß

Temperature Monitoring System with LCD Display and DC Motor Control is a microcontroller-based project that monitors temperature using an ADC and displays the readings on an LCD. If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, DC motors are activated. This project is built using the 8051 microcontroller, interfacing with an LCD, ADC, and DC motors. Additionally, the Proteus circuit simulation is provided to visualize and test the project.

## Features üöÄ

- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Display of temperature readings on an LCD
- Activation of DC motors when temperature exceeds a threshold
- User-friendly setup and operation
- Proteus circuit simulation for easy testing and visualization

## How to Use üîç

1. Assemble the hardware components and ensure all connections are secure.
2. Power on the system.
3. The LCD will display a welcome message followed by temperature readings.
4. If the temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius, the DC motors will activate.
